The Jellyfin app on Xbox has been unmaintained for quite a while. 
While it was on lifesupport for the last couple of years, we were occasually merging PRs and fixing bugs though the last release is now over 5 years ago.

As there is still continued intrest in the application and for Jellyfin to be available on Xbox overall, i decided to take over at least the superficial duties of keeping it operational and releasing if there are new Features or Bugfixes.

# UWP 0.9.0 release

This new release has now been approved and is available as a new version in the microsoft store for up-to-date Xbox consoles.

It generally contains a number of bugfixes but namely also the Update to WebView2. 
As the app is nothing more then an Web-Browser with a few tweeks, this is a huge step up and allows xboxs to use a chromium based browser instead of the old Legacy-Edge one. 
This brings for example the capabilities to display HVEC encoded media alongside a few other features that makes the whole experience quite a bit better.

# What to expect

I will be actively managing pull requests and try my best with bug reports, though we are still very reliant on your help with new features and bugfixes. 
If there are enough features and bug fixes done and merged, you can however expect more releases in the future although i will not give a definitive timeline for that.
